Quality Assurance Indicator: capturing in an integrated way the interactions between classes and the distribution of the control flow in a software system.

In this paper, we wanted to investigate thoroughly if the Qi metric, as a synthetic metric, can be used to support the applicability of Lehman’s laws of software evolution [4, 5]. We focused on the Lehman’s laws related with continuing change, increasing complexity, continuing growth and declining quality.

We used the number of classes as an indicator of size.
This attribute has been used by Lee [9] to confirm continuing growth.
We extended our analysis by using other size indicators. In addition to the size indica-
tors SLOC, SNOC and LOC used in section 4.2.1, we used the number of operations per class (NOO).

In order to analyze how software quality changes as software evolves, we used the number of reported defects. A higher occurrence of faults is considered as a sign of poor quality. From the curves given in Figure 5 and Figure 6 (increasing complexity), we can clearly observe that the complexity of the two systems increases, according to the three metrics (RFC, WMC and CBO). In fact, an increasing complexity of a software system often symbolizes a decrease in its quality.
